# CLASSWORK

1. Let's do a new madlib program. Use the  string madlib and the .replace(old,new) method  to replace the ADJECTIVE, VERBS,NOUNS..etc  in  the string with user entered strings.
```
#string.replace(old, new)

madlib = '''Two *NOUN1*, both alike in dignity,
In fair *PLACE1*, where we lay our scene,
From ancient *NOUN2* break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-crossd *NOUN3* take their life;
Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their *NOUN4* bury their parents strife.
The fearful passage of their *ADJECTIVE2* love,
And the continuance of their parents rage,
Which, but their childrens end, nought could *VERB1* ,
Is now the *NUMBER* hours traffic of our stage;
The which if you with *ADJECTIVE3* *BODYPART* attend,
What here shall *VERB2*, our toil shall strive to mend.'''
