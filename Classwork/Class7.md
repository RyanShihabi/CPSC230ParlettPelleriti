# If/Elif/Else, For, while
1. Code a number guessing game that creates a variable called correct and sets it equal to any integer you want. Then, it asks the user to guess an integer. Until they guess the correct integer, tell them whether they were too low, or too high, and ask them to guess again.

2. Look at every number between 1 and 100, and print out only the numbers that are "abundant" numbers.

3. Write a script that asks the user for an integer. Then using if/elif/else print out whether their number is positive, negative, or 0.

4. Write a script that checks a user inputted string to see if it contains at least ONE occurence of each vowel (case doesnt matter).
