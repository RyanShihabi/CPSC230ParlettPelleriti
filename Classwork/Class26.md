* Change the Tamagotchi Code from Class. Add a new class attribute, education, and set it to 0. Add a new Class Method called school() which takes the argument course_credits and adds 1 to the class attribute, self.education, for each course credit.
* Create another class attribute called level, set it to 0. Create a class method called PowerUp() that takes in the argument gold_coins. It takes 10 gold coins to move up a level. Calculate how many levels the Tamagotchi can go up, and change it in the attribute level. Print a message to the user telling them the new level of their Tamagotchi.
