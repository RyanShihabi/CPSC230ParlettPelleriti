1. Put the names of your groupmates in a list (example below), then use a for
loop to print out "You're a valuable human being with valid feelings, [Name]"
for each name.
'''
names = ["Chelsea", "John", "Jane", "Glenn", "Joey", "Mike"]

'''
2. Using a for loop and range(), calculate the sum of all the

3. Using a for loop, count the number of a's, e's, i's, o's, and u's in

4. A perfect number is defined as a number whos factors (other than itself)
add up to itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because its factors
1,2 and 3 add up to 6.

A deficient number is one where the sum of its factors (other than itself)
is LESS than itself. For example, 8 (1,2,4), or 9 (1,3).

An abundant number is one where the sum of its factors (other than itself)
is GREATER than itself. For example 12 (1,2,3,4,6).

Write a python script that checks whether a number, x, is perfect, deficient,
or abundant.
