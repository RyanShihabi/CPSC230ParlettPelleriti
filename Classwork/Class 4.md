# Variables, Types, Operators, and Imports
1. Create two variables a and b, and set them equal to any numbers (ints) that you want. write some code to figure out the  hypotnuse of a triangle with sides of length a and b. Assign that value  to the variable c. DON'T just use math.hypot()! Then check that it's the same as the result given by math.hypot().

2. Use all the integers 1,2,3,4,and 5 and the operators +,-,\*,/,//, \*\*,  and % to create these integers (you can't use two numbers concatenated together, for example you can't use 1 and 5 to make 15):
  * EXAMPLE: 100 = 1 * 4 * 5 * (2+3)
  * 10
  * 27
  * 90
  * 61
  * 62

3. Create a script that calculates the amount of money in your bank account after t (an integer) number of years, if the interest rate is i (a float). Calculate [compound interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp).
```
t = ??
i = ??
original_amount = 3123
# your formula here #
money = ???

```
4. Write a script that will take user input and ask for a *diameter*, then calculate and print out the circumference and area of the circle with that diameter.
