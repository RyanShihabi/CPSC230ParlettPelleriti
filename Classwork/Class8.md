# Algorithms
1. CREATE YOUR OWN ALGORITHM

Whatâ€™s a simple problem you have?
How to split rent  and utilities?
Decide whether to go out at night?
Decide what to name your kid?
Write a SIMPLE program to solve it!

2. Create some code that checks if a word that a user inputs is a palindrome (a word that is the same backwards and forwards). Make sure  to account for whether they use capital letters or not.

3. Create some code that takes the string j and prints out only words that have more than 3 vowels. HINT: string.split()
