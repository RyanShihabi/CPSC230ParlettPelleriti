'''
1. Grab and print the name "Chelsea" from the following strings using string
slicing.
'''

s1 = "My Name is Chelsea"
s2 = "Her Favorite Football Team is Chelsea or maybe Man U."
s3 = "Chelsea"
s4 = "aelehC" # hint [::]
s5 = "Chelsea Parlett"

'''
2. Ask the user for a word as input and store it in the variable, palindrome.
Then, check whether their word is a palindrome (the same forwards and backwards
like the word kayak). If it is, print out a message informing them.
'''


'''
3. A friend has left you a hidden message in the string below, but they've
told you that to find it, you have to look at every other letter starting at
the END of the string and moving towards the beginning. Luckily you know how
to use Python for that. Print out their message below.
'''

hiddenMessage = "tDafegrhGr hgjnkipoqDd hekrv'cudosY"


'''
4. Using a while loop to loop through the indices (remember indexing starts
at 0 in python), write some code that counts the number of vowels in a user
inputted string. Make sure you use the in operator.
'''

'''
5. Use + and * operators with strings to print out the lyrics to "Work" by
Rhianna more efficiently (e.g. instead of typing "work work work work work" how
can we use the * operator?)
'''

lyrics = '''Work, work, work, work, work, work
He said me haffi work, work, work, work, work, work
He see me do mi dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
So me put in work, work, work, work, work, work
When you ah gon' learn, learn, learn, learn, learn?
Me nuh care if him hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurting
'''
