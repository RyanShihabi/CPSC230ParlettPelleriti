# CLASSWORK
1. Write a  function called gnirts() that  takes in a string and returns the string backwards

2. Write a function prime() that checks if a number is prime and returns True or False

3. Write a function called SpOnGeMoCk() that takes in a string called sarcasm, as an argument and returns that string in "SpongeMock" (with every other letter capitalized). For example "Chelsea" should come out "ChElSeA". Make sure to account for the fact that the word may already have capital letters.
