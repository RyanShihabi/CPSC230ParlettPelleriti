# If/ELSE, FOR, WHILE

1. Rewrite  the code from our last classwork while loop as a for loop  using  range().(print all numbers between 0 and 200 that are divisible by both 5 and 7.)

2. Create a variable y and set it equal to 257. Check if 257 is a prime  number by checking  if it's divisible by ANY number between 2 and 256. If it  is prime, print "prime",  otherwise print "not prime"

3. Use the code from  the last classwork to ask  the user  for a number between 3 and 100, store the input  in the variable k.

print all the prime numbers between 2 and k (including 2 and  k). Use *break* to immediately move on to  the next number if you find a divisor that is not 1 or  itself.

HINT: you only need to check if a number is divisible numbers LESS than it.
