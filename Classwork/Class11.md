#Instructions
1. Write a script that asks users to give them 10 even numbers, and then iteratively checks each to see if they're even. You should return a list called bool that has True if the number at that index was even, and False otherwise.

for example:
```
#if the final list you get from input is
l = [1,2,3,6,8,10]

#you should output
bool = [False, True, False, True, True, True]
```
