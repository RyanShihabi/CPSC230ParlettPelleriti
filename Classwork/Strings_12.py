1. Let's do a new madlib program. Use the  string madlib and the
.replace(old,new) method  to replace the ADJECTIVE, VERBS,NOUNS..etc
in the string with user entered strings.
'''

#string.replace(old, new)

madlib = '''Two *NOUN1*, both alike in dignity,
In fair *PLACE1*, where we lay our scene,
From ancient *NOUN2* break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-crossd *NOUN3* take their life;
Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their *NOUN4* bury their parents strife.
The fearful passage of their *ADJECTIVE2* love,
And the continuance of their parents rage,
Which, but their childrens end, nought could *VERB1* ,
Is now the *NUMBER* hours traffic of our stage;
The which if you with *ADJECTIVE3* *BODYPART* attend,
What here shall *VERB2*, our toil shall strive to mend.'''

2. Write a program that asks the user who the host of Jeopardy was from 1984
until 2020. Make sure to cont them as correct even if they use different
capitalization, or if they have extra spaces in their answer. If they're
correct print "Correct!" and finish the program. Otherwise ask them to
answer again.

3. Re-create and extend our password example from Classwork 7. Ask
the user to enter a potential password, and check if it meets your critera.
If their password does not meet the criteria, tell them why, and ask them
for a new password. Continue to ask them for a new password if their old one
is bad. Make sure each password:

- is at least 10 characters long
- is not "Password123"
- contains at least one of the following characters: !@$%&
- has at least one alphabetical character
- has at least one number
- is less than 50 characters long
