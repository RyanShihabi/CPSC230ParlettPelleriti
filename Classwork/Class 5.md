# IF/LOOPS

1. Create some code that checks whether a number is even. If it is,  print "even", otherwise print "odd"

```x = int(input("Give me a number"))
```
2. using a while loop, print all numbers between 0 and 200 that are divisible by both 5 and 7.

3. What's wrong with this while loop, and how do I fix it?

```
x = 1
while x < 10:
  print("yo")
```
4. Write a program that asks the user for a word. Check if the word is more than 10 characters long. Tell them the answer, and then print how long the word is.
