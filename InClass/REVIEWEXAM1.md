## Questions?

## TOPICS THAT MIGHT BE ON THE TEST (NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST)
* Variables (what are they, how do we create them? Use them?)
* IF/ELIF/ELSE (Note: can you use an elif without first using an if?)
* WHILE loops (syntax, why do we use them?)
* FOR loops (syntax, why do we use them?)
* STRINGS (slicing, getting them from the user, checking strings for things)
* LISTS (what are they, how do we make them, how do we use them?)
