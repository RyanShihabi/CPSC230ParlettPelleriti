#I HATE E's!
# ask the user to input a string, print all the letters
# except "e" using continue. What would happen if I really hated
# e's and wanted to stop printing if I found one?

#Perfect number
#Perfect numbers occur when the sum
#of a number's divisors (except itself), equals that number
#e.g. 6 = 1 + 2 + 3
num = int(input("Give me an int:"))
divSum = 0

for n in range(1,num):
    if num%n == 0:
        divSum += n
if.....?

# Use if/elif/else to do abundant and deficient
#use a while loop to keep prompting user until
#they give a perfect num (use sentinel loop)


#PLAY PIG!
