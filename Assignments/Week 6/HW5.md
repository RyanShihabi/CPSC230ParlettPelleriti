# STATS.py
Write a program that continually prompts the user for positive integer values and stores them in a list.  You should stop prompting when the user enters a negative integer value.

When the user is done entering values, you should print the list of integers they have provided in sorted order.  You should then compute the mean of the values in the list and print it.

Recall that the mean is just the arithmetic average...the sum of all the values divided by the number of values.
